# Password Generator/Validator
---

This is a small tool I made one night to ensure that I understand password validation and strength. This simple console script can either create a strong password for the user to keep or can validate an existing one.

The rules I followed for validation are:
1. Atleast 8 characters long
2. Atleast one uppercase and one lowercase letter
3. Atleast one number
4. Atleast one special character
